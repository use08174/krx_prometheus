     - Use `$$` for block-level formulas.
     - Use `$` for inline formulas.

#### 4. **Handle Tables in Markdown Format**:
   - Identify any **tables** in the text and convert them into **Markdown table format**.
   - Ensure proper alignment and labeling of table columns and rows.
   - Provide a brief **caption** in Korean to describe the table if necessary.

#### 5. **Quality Control and Final Output**:

   - The translated text must be written in fluent Korean.
   - Proper headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) should be used to organize the content in Markdown.

2. **Formatted Formulas**:
   - All mathematical formulas must be presented as valid LaTeX in code blocks:
     - Example:
       ```latex
       $$ FV_n = PV_0 \cdot (1 + \frac{i}{m})^{m \cdot n} $$
       ```

3. **Formatted Tables**:
   - Tables must be formatted in Markdown table syntax:
     - Example:
       ```markdown
       | Year | Cash Flow | Discount Rate |
       |------|-----------|---------------|
       | 1    | 1,000     | 5%            |
       | 2    | 1,200     | 5%            |
       ```

4. **Output in Markdown**:
   - The entire output must be presented in **Markdown format** for seamless integration with other tools.
